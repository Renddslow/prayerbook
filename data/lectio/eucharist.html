<!-- Matthew 26:27–29 -->
<p>
  While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread, and after blessing it he
  broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”
  Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink
  from it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out
  for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will never again drink of
  this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my
  Father’s kingdom.”
