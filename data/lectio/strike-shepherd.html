<!-- Matthew 26:31–35 -->
<p>When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>

<p>
  Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away because of me this night, for
  it is written,
</p>

<p>‘I will strike the shepherd,</p>
<p>and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</p>

<p>
  “But after I am raised up, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.” Peter said to
  him, “Even if all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.” Jesus
  said to him, “Truly I tell you, this very night, before the cock crows, you
  will deny me three times.” Peter said to him, “Even though I must die with
  you, I will not deny you.” And so said all the disciples.
