<!-- Exodus 20:4â€“6 -->
<p>
  You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that
  is in heaven above or that is on the earth beneath or that is in the water
  under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord
  your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents to
  the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me but showing
  steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my
  commandments.
