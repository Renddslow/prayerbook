<!-- Exodus 20:8–11 -->
<p>
  Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all
  your work. But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; you shall
  not do any work—you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave,
  your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns. For in six days the Lord
  made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the
  seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and consecrated it.
