<!-- Matthew 26:47–56 -->
<p>
  While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived; with him was a
  large crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of
  the people. Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I will
  kiss is the man; arrest him.” At once he came up to Jesus and said,
  “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him. Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you
  are here to do.” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.
  Suddenly one of those with Jesus put his hand on his sword, drew it, and
  struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his ear. Then Jesus said to
  him, “Put your sword back into its place, for all who take the sword will die
  by the sword. Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at
  once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the
  scriptures be fulfilled, which say it must happen in this way?” At that hour
  Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest
  me as though I were a rebel? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and
  you did not arrest me. But all this has taken place, so that the scriptures of
  the prophets may be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.
