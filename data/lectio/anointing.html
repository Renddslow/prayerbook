<!-- Matthew 26:6–13 -->
<p>
  Now while Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, a woman came
  to him with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment, and she poured it on his
  head as he sat at the table. But when the disciples saw it, they were angry
  and said, “Why this waste? For this ointment could have been sold for a large
  sum and the money given to the poor.” But Jesus, aware of this, said to them,
  “Why do you trouble the woman? She has performed a good service for me. For
  you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. By pouring
  this ointment on my body she has prepared me for burial. Truly I tell you,
  wherever this good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done
  will be told in remembrance of her.”
