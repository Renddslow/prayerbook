<!-- Matthew 26:36–46 -->
<p>
  Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his
  disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” He took with him Peter
  and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be grieved and agitated. Then he said
  to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and stay
  awake with me.” And going a little farther, he threw himself on the ground and
  prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me, yet not what
  I want but what you want.” Then he came to the disciples and found them
  sleeping, and he said to Peter, “So, could you not stay awake with me one
  hour? Stay awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the
  spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” Again he went away for the
  second time and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it,
  your will be done.” Again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were
  heavy. So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time,
  saying the same words. Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are
  you still sleeping and taking your rest? Now the hour is at hand, and the Son
  of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Get up, let us be going. Look,
  my betrayer is at hand.”
