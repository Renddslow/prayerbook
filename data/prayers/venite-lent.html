<p>O come, let us sing unto the Lord;</p>
<p class="pb-indent">
  let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.
</p>
<p>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and show ourselves glad in him with psalms.</p>
<p>For the Lord is a great God</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and a great King above all gods.</p>
<p>In his hand are all the depths of the earth,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and the heights of the hills are his also.</p>
<p>The sea is his, for he made it,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and his hands prepared the dry land.</p>
<p>O come, let us worship and fall down,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</p>
<p>For he is our God,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and we are the people of his pasture,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and the sheep of his hand.</p>
<p>Today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts</p>
<p class="pb-indent">
  as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness,
</p>
<p>When your fathers tested me,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and put me to the proof, though they had seen my works.</p>
<p>Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">
  “It is a people that err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways,”
</p>
<p>Of whom I swore in my wrath</p>
<p class="pb-indent">that they should not enter into my rest.</p>
