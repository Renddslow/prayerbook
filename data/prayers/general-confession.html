  Let us humbly confess our sins to Almighty God.
</p>

<p>Almighty and most merciful Father,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">
  we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep.
</p>
<p class="pb-hanging-indent">
  We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts.
</p>
<p class="pb-hanging-indent">We have offended against your holy laws.</p>
<p class="pb-hanging-indent">
  We have left undone those things which we ought to have done, and we have done
  those things which we ought not to have done;
</p>
<p>and apart from your grace, there is no health in us.</p>
<p>O Lord, have mercy upon us.</p>
<p>Spare all those who confess their faults.</p>
<p class="pb-hanging-indent">
  Restore all those who are penitent, according to your promises declared to all
  people in Christ Jesus our Lord.
</p>
<p class="pb-hanging-indent">
  And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake, that we may now live a godly,
  righteous, and sober life, to the glory of your holy Name.
  <strong>Amen.</strong>
</p>
