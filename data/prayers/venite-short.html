<p>O come, let us sing unto the Lord;</p>
<p class="pb-indent">
  let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.
</p>
<p>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and show ourselves glad in him with psalms.</p>
<p>For the Lord is a great God</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and a great King above all gods.</p>
<p>In his hand are all the depths of the earth,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and the heights of the hills are his also.</p>
<p>The sea is his, for he made it,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and his hands prepared the dry land.</p>
<p>O come, let us worship and fall down,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</p>
<p>For he is our God,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and we are the people of his pasture,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and the sheep of his hand.</p>
