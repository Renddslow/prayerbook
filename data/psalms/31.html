<p>To the leader. A Psalm of David.</p>
<p>In you, O Lord, I seek refuge;</p>
<p>do not let me ever be put to shame;</p>
<p>in your righteousness deliver me.</p>
<p>Incline your ear to me;</p>
<p>rescue me speedily.</p>
<p>Be a rock of refuge for me,</p>
<p>a strong fortress to save me.</p>
<p>You are indeed my rock and my fortress;</p>
<p>for your name’s sake lead me and guide me;</p>
<p>take me out of the net that is hidden for me,</p>
<p>for you are my refuge.</p>
<p>Into your hand I commit my spirit;</p>
<p>you have redeemed me, O Lord, faithful God.</p>
<p>You hate those who pay regard to worthless idols,</p>
<p>but I trust in the Lord.</p>
<p>I will exult and rejoice in your steadfast love,</p>
<p>because you have seen my affliction;</p>
<p>you have taken notice of my adversities</p>
<p>and have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy;</p>
<p>you have set my feet in a broad place.</p>
<p>Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am in distress;</p>
<p>my eye wastes away from grief,</p>
<p>my soul and body also.</p>
<p>For my life is spent with sorrow</p>
<p>and my years with sighing;</p>
<p>my strength fails because of my misery,</p>
<p>and my bones waste away.</p>
<p>I am the scorn of all my adversaries,</p>
<p>a horror to my neighbors,</p>
<p>an object of dread to my acquaintances;</p>
<p>those who see me in the street flee from me.</p>
<p>I have passed out of mind like one who is dead;</p>
<p>I have become like a broken vessel.</p>
<p>For I hear the whispering of many—</p>
<p>terror all around!—</p>
<p>as they scheme together against me,</p>
<p>as they plot to take my life.</p>
<p>But I trust in you, O Lord;</p>
<p>I say, “You are my God.”</p>
<p>My times are in your hand;</p>
<p>deliver me from the hand of my enemies and persecutors.</p>
<p>Let your face shine upon your servant;</p>
<p>save me in your steadfast love.</p>
<p>Do not let me be put to shame, O Lord,</p>
<p>for I call on you;</p>
<p>let the wicked be put to shame;</p>
<p>let them go dumbfounded to Sheol.</p>
<p>Let the lying lips be stilled</p>
<p>that speak insolently against the righteous</p>
<p>with pride and contempt.</p>
<p>O how abundant is your goodness</p>
<p>that you have laid up for those who fear you</p>
<p>and accomplished for those who take refuge in you,</p>
<p>in the sight of everyone!</p>
<p>In the shelter of your presence you hide them</p>
<p>from human plots;</p>
<p>you hold them safe under your shelter</p>
<p>from contentious tongues.</p>
<p>Blessed be the Lord,</p>
<p>for he has wondrously shown his steadfast love to me</p>
<p>when I was beset as a city under siege.</p>
<p>I had said in my alarm,</p>
<p>“I am driven far from your sight.”</p>
<p>But you heard my supplications</p>
<p>when I cried out to you for help.</p>
<p>Love the Lord, all you his saints.</p>
<p>The Lord preserves the faithful</p>
<p>but abundantly repays the one who acts haughtily.</p>
<p>Be strong, and let your heart take courage,</p>
<p>all you who wait for the Lord.</p>
