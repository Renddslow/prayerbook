<p>Of David. A Psalm.</p>
<p>The earth is the Lordâ€™s and all that is in it,</p>
<p>the world, and those who live in it,</p>
<p>for he has founded it on the seas</p>
<p>and established it on the rivers.</p>
<p>Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord?</p>
<p>And who shall stand in his holy place?</p>
<p>Those who have clean hands and pure hearts,</p>
<p>who do not lift up their souls to what is false</p>
<p>and do not swear deceitfully.</p>
<p>They will receive blessing from the Lord</p>
<p>and vindication from the God of their salvation.</p>
<p>Such is the company of those who seek him,</p>
<p>who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah</p>
<p>Lift up your heads, O gates!</p>
<p>and be lifted up, O ancient doors,</p>
<p>that the King of glory may come in!</p>
<p>Who is the King of glory?</p>
<p>The Lord, strong and mighty,</p>
<p>the Lord, mighty in battle.</p>
<p>Lift up your heads, O gates!</p>
<p>and be lifted up, O ancient doors,</p>
<p>that the King of glory may come in!</p>
<p>Who is this King of glory?</p>
<p>The Lord of hosts,</p>
<p>he is the King of glory. Selah</p>
