<p>Of David.</p>
<p>Contend, O Lord, with those who contend with me;</p>
<p>fight against those who fight against me!</p>
<p>Take hold of shield and buckler,</p>
<p>and rise up to help me!</p>
<p>Draw the spear and javelin</p>
<p>against my pursuers;</p>
<p>say to my soul,</p>
<p>“I am your salvation.”</p>
<p>Let them be put to shame and dishonor</p>
<p>who seek after my life.</p>
<p>Let them be turned back and confounded</p>
<p>who devise evil against me.</p>
<p>Let them be like chaff before the wind,</p>
<p>with the angel of the Lord driving them on.</p>
<p>Let their way be dark and slippery,</p>
<p>with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.</p>
<p>For without cause they hid their net for me;</p>
<p>without cause they dug a pit for my life.</p>
<p>Let ruin come on them unawares,</p>
<p>and let the net that they hid ensnare them;</p>
<p>let them fall in it—to their ruin.</p>
<p>Then my soul shall rejoice in the Lord,</p>
<p>exulting in his deliverance.</p>
<p>All my bones shall say,</p>
<p>“O Lord, who is like you?</p>
<p>You deliver the weak</p>
<p>from those too strong for them,</p>
<p>the weak and needy from those who despoil them.”</p>
<p>Malicious witnesses rise up;</p>
<p>they ask me about things I do not know.</p>
<p>They repay me evil for good;</p>
<p>my soul is forlorn.</p>
<p>But as for me, when they were sick,</p>
<p>I wore sackcloth;</p>
<p>I afflicted myself with fasting.</p>
<p>I prayed with head bowed on my bosom,</p>
<p>as though I grieved for a friend or a brother;</p>
<p>I went about as one who laments for a mother,</p>
<p>bowed down and in mourning.</p>
<p>But at my stumbling they gathered in glee;</p>
<p>they gathered together against me;</p>
<p>ruffians whom I did not know</p>
<p>tore at me without ceasing;</p>
<p>they impiously mocked more and more,</p>
<p>gnashing at me with their teeth.</p>
<p>How long, O Lord, will you look on?</p>
<p>Rescue me from their ravages,</p>
<p>my life from the lions!</p>
<p>Then I will thank you in the great congregation;</p>
<p>in the mighty throng I will praise you.</p>
<p>Do not let my treacherous enemies rejoice over me</p>
<p>or those who hate me without cause wink the eye.</p>
<p>For they do not speak peace,</p>
<p>but they conceive deceitful words</p>
<p>against those who are quiet in the land.</p>
<p>They open wide their mouths against me;</p>
<p>they say, “Aha, Aha,</p>
<p>our eyes have seen it.”</p>
<p>You have seen, O Lord; do not be silent!</p>
<p>O Lord, do not be far from me!</p>
<p>Wake up! Rouse yourself for my defense,</p>
<p>for my cause, my God and my Lord!</p>
<p>Vindicate me, O Lord, my God,</p>
<p>according to your righteousness,</p>
<p>and do not let them rejoice over me.</p>
<p>Do not let them say to themselves,</p>
<p>“Aha, we have our heart’s desire.”</p>
<p>Do not let them say, “We have swallowed you up.”</p>
<p>Let all those who rejoice at my calamity</p>
<p>be put to shame and confusion;</p>
<p>let those who exalt themselves against me</p>
<p>be clothed with shame and dishonor.</p>
<p>Let those who desire my vindication</p>
<p>shout for joy and be glad</p>
<p>and say evermore,</p>
<p>“Great is the Lord,</p>
<p>who delights in the welfare of his servant.”</p>
<p>Then my tongue shall tell of your righteousness</p>
<p>and of your praise all day long.</p>
