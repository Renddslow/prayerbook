<p>A Psalm of David.</p>
<p>Ascribe to Yahweh, O heavenly beings,</p>
<p>ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.</p>
<p>Ascribe to Yahweh the glory of his name;</p>
<p>worship Yahweh in holy splendor.</p>
<p>The voice of Yahweh is over the waters;</p>
<p>the God of glory thunders,</p>
<p>Yahweh, over mighty waters.</p>
<p>The voice of Yahweh is powerful;</p>
<p>the voice of Yahweh is full of majesty.</p>
<p>The voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars;</p>
<p>Yahweh breaks the cedars of Lebanon.</p>
<p>He makes Lebanon skip like a calf</p>
<p>and Sirion like a young wild ox.</p>
<p>The voice of Yahweh flashes forth flames of fire.</p>
<p>The voice of Yahweh shakes the wilderness;</p>
<p>Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.</p>
<p>The voice of Yahweh causes the oaks to whirl</p>
<p>and strips the forest bare,</p>
<p>and in his temple all say, “Glory!”</p>
<p>Yahweh sits enthroned over the flood;</p>
<p>Yahweh sits enthroned as king forever.</p>
<p>May Yahweh give strength to his people!</p>
<p>May Yahweh bless his people with peace!</p>
