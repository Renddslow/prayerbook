<p>A Psalm of David.</p>
<p>Ascribe to the Lord, O heavenly beings,</p>
<p>ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.</p>
<p>Ascribe to the Lord the glory of his name;</p>
<p>worship the Lord in holy splendor.</p>
<p>The voice of the Lord is over the waters;</p>
<p>the God of glory thunders,</p>
<p>the Lord, over mighty waters.</p>
<p>The voice of the Lord is powerful;</p>
<p>the voice of the Lord is full of majesty.</p>
<p>The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars;</p>
<p>the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon.</p>
<p>He makes Lebanon skip like a calf</p>
<p>and Sirion like a young wild ox.</p>
<p>The voice of the Lord flashes forth flames of fire.</p>
<p>The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness;</p>
<p>the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.</p>
<p>The voice of the Lord causes the oaks to whirl</p>
<p>and strips the forest bare,</p>
<p>and in his temple all say, “Glory!”</p>
<p>The Lord sits enthroned over the flood;</p>
<p>the Lord sits enthroned as king forever.</p>
<p>May the Lord give strength to his people!</p>
<p>May the Lord bless his people with peace!</p>
