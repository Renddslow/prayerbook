<p>A Psalm of David, for the memorial offering.</p>
<p>O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger</p>
<p>or discipline me in your wrath.</p>
<p>For your arrows have sunk into me,</p>
<p>and your hand has come down on me.</p>
<p>There is no soundness in my flesh</p>
<p>because of your indignation;</p>
<p>there is no health in my bones</p>
<p>because of my sin.</p>
<p>For my iniquities have gone over my head;</p>
<p>they weigh like a burden too heavy for me.</p>
<p>My wounds grow foul and fester</p>
<p>because of my foolishness;</p>
<p>I am utterly bowed down and prostrate;</p>
<p>all day long I go around mourning.</p>
<p>For my loins are filled with burning,</p>
<p>and there is no soundness in my flesh.</p>
<p>I am utterly spent and crushed;</p>
<p>I groan because of the tumult of my heart.</p>
<p>O Lord, all my longing is known to you;</p>
<p>my sighing is not hidden from you.</p>
<p>My heart throbs; my strength fails me;</p>
<p>as for the light of my eyes—it also has gone from me.</p>
<p>My friends and companions stand aloof from my affliction,</p>
<p>and my neighbors stand far off.</p>
<p>Those who seek my life lay their snares;</p>
<p>those who seek to hurt me speak of ruin</p>
<p>and meditate on treachery all day long.</p>
<p>But I am like the deaf; I do not hear;</p>
<p>like the mute, who cannot speak.</p>
<p>Truly, I am like one who does not hear</p>
<p>and in whose mouth is no retort.</p>
<p>But it is for you, O Lord, that I wait;</p>
<p>it is you, O Lord my God, who will answer.</p>
<p>For I pray, “Only do not let them rejoice over me,</p>
<p>those who boast against me when my foot slips.”</p>
<p>For I am ready to fall,</p>
<p>and my pain is ever with me.</p>
<p>I confess my iniquity;</p>
<p>I am sorry for my sin.</p>
<p>Those who are my foes without cause are mighty,</p>
<p>and many are those who hate me wrongfully.</p>
<p>Those who render me evil for good</p>
<p>are my adversaries because I follow after good.</p>
<p>Do not forsake me, O Lord;</p>
<p>O my God, do not be far from me;</p>
<p>make haste to help me,</p>
<p>O Lord, my salvation.</p>
