<p>A Psalm. A Song at the dedication of the temple. Of David.</p>
<p>I will extol you, O Lord, for you have drawn me up</p>
<p>and did not let my foes rejoice over me.</p>
<p>O Lord my God, I cried to you for help,</p>
<p>and you have healed me.</p>
<p>O Lord, you brought up my soul from Sheol,</p>
<p>restored me to life from among those gone down to the Pit.</p>
<p>Sing praises to Yahweh, O you his faithful ones,</p>
<p>and give thanks to his holy name.</p>
<p>For his anger is but for a moment;</p>
<p>his favor is for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Weeping may linger for the night,</p>
<p>but joy comes with the morning.</p>
<p>As for me, I said in my prosperity,</p>
<p>“I shall never be moved.”</p>
<p>By your favor, O Lord,</p>
<p>you had established me as a strong mountain;</p>
<p>you hid your face;</p>
<p>I was dismayed.</p>
<p>To you, O Lord, I cried,</p>
<p>and to Yahweh I made supplication:</p>
<p>“What profit is there in my death,</p>
<p>if I go down to the Pit?</p>
<p>Will the dust praise you?</p>
<p>Will it tell of your faithfulness?</p>
<p>Hear, O Lord, and be gracious to me!</p>
<p>O Lord, be my helper!”</p>
<p>You have turned my mourning into dancing;</p>
<p>you have taken off my sackcloth</p>
<p>and clothed me with joy,</p>
<p>so that my soul may praise you and not be silent.</p>
<p>O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever.</p>
