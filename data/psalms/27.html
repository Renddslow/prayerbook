<p>Of David.</p>
<p>The Lord is my light and my salvation;</p>
<p>whom shall I fear?</p>
<p>The Lord is the stronghold of my life;</p>
<p>of whom shall I be afraid?</p>
<p>When evildoers assail me</p>
<p>to devour my flesh—</p>
<p>my adversaries and foes—</p>
<p>they shall stumble and fall.</p>
<p>Though an army encamp against me,</p>
<p>my heart shall not fear;</p>
<p>though war rise up against me,</p>
<p>yet I will be confident.</p>
<p>One thing I asked of the Lord;</p>
<p>this I seek:</p>
<p>to live in the house of the Lord</p>
<p>all the days of my life,</p>
<p>to behold the beauty of the Lord,</p>
<p>and to inquire in his temple.</p>
<p>For he will hide me in his shelter</p>
<p>in the day of trouble;</p>
<p>he will conceal me under the cover of his tent;</p>
<p>he will set me high on a rock.</p>
<p>Now my head is lifted up</p>
<p>above my enemies all around me,</p>
<p>and I will offer in his tent</p>
<p>sacrifices with shouts of joy;</p>
<p>I will sing and make melody to the Lord.</p>
<p></p>Hear, O Lord, when I cry aloud;</p>
<p>be gracious to me and answer me!</p>
<p>“Come,” my heart says, “seek his face!”</p>
<p>Your face, Lord, do I seek.</p>
<p>Do not hide your face from me.</p>
<p>Do not turn your servant away in anger,</p>
<p>you who have been my help.</p>
<p>Do not cast me off; do not forsake me,</p>
<p>O God of my salvation!</p>
<p>If my father and mother forsake me,</p>
<p>the Lord will take me up.</p>
<p>Teach me your way, O Lord,</p>
<p>and lead me on a level path</p>
<p>because of my enemies.</p>
<p>Do not give me up to the will of my adversaries,</p>
<p>for false witnesses have risen against me,</p>
<p>and they are breathing out violence.</p>
<p>I believe that I shall see the goodness of the Lord</p>
<p>in the land of the living.</p>
<p>Wait for the Lord;</p>
<p>be strong, and let your heart take courage;</p>
<p>wait for the Lord!</p>
