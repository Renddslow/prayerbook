<p>Of David.</p>
<p>Vindicate me, O Lord,</p>
<p>for I have walked in my integrity,</p>
<p>and I have trusted in Yahweh without wavering.</p>
<p>Prove me, O Lord, and try me;</p>
<p>test my heart and mind.</p>
<p>For your steadfast love is before my eyes,</p>
<p>and I walk in faithfulness to you.</p>
<p>I do not sit with the worthless,</p>
<p>nor do I consort with hypocrites;</p>
<p>I hate the company of evildoers</p>
<p>and will not sit with the wicked.</p>
<p>I wash my hands in innocence</p>
<p>and go around your altar, O Lord,</p>
<p>singing aloud a song of thanksgiving</p>
<p>and telling all your wondrous deeds.</p>
<p>O Lord, I love the house in which you dwell</p>
<p>and the place where your glory abides.</p>
<p>Do not sweep me away with sinners</p>
<p>nor my life with the bloodthirsty,</p>
<p>those in whose hands are evil devices</p>
<p>and whose right hands are full of bribes.</p>
<p>But as for me, I walk in my integrity;</p>
<p>redeem me and be gracious to me.</p>
<p>My foot stands on level ground;</p>
<p>in the great congregation I will bless Yahweh.</p>
