<p>Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous.</p>
<p>Praise befits the upright.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord with the lyre;</p>
<p>make melody to him with the harp of ten strings.</p>
<p>Sing to him a new song;</p>
<p>play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts.</p>
<p>For the word of the Lord is upright,</p>
<p>and all his work is done in faithfulness.</p>
<p>He loves righteousness and justice;</p>
<p>the earth is full of the steadfast love of the Lord.</p>
<p>By the word of the Lord the heavens were made</p>
<p>and all their host by the breath of his mouth.</p>
<p>He gathered the waters of the sea as in a bottle;</p>
<p>he put the deeps in storehouses.</p>
<p>Let all the earth fear the Lord;</p>
<p>let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him,</p>
<p>for he spoke, and it came to be;</p>
<p>he commanded, and it stood firm.</p>
<p>The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing;</p>
<p>he frustrates the plans of the peoples.</p>
<p>The counsel of the Lord stands forever,</p>
<p>the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</p>
<p>Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord,</p>
<p>the people whom he has chosen as his heritage.</p>
<p>The Lord looks down from heaven;</p>
<p>he sees all humankind.</p>
<p>From where he sits enthroned he watches</p>
<p>all the inhabitants of the earthâ€”</p>
<p>he who fashions the hearts of them all</p>
<p>and observes all their deeds.</p>
<p>A king is not saved by his great army;</p>
<p>a warrior is not delivered by his great strength.</p>
<p>The war horse is a vain hope for victory,</p>
<p>and by its great might it cannot save.</p>
<p>Truly the eye of the Lord is on those who fear him,</p>
<p>on those who hope in his steadfast love,</p>
<p>to deliver their soul from death</p>
<p>and to keep them alive in famine.</p>
<p>Our soul waits for the Lord;</p>
<p>he is our help and shield.</p>
<p>Our heart is glad in him</p>
<p>because we trust in his holy name.</p>
<p>Let your steadfast love, O Lord, be upon us,</p>
<p>even as we hope in you.</p>
