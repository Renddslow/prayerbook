<p>
  Of David, when he feigned madness before Abimelech, so that he drove him out,
  and he went away.
</p>
<p>I will bless Yahweh at all times;</p>
<p>his praise shall continually be in my mouth.</p>
<p>My soul makes its boast in Yahweh;</p>
<p>let the humble hear and be glad.</p>
<p>O magnify Yahweh with me,</p>
<p>and let us exalt his name together.</p>
<p>I sought Yahweh, and he answered me</p>
<p>and delivered me from all my fears.</p>
<p>Look to him, and be radiant,</p>
<p>so your faces shall never be ashamed.</p>
<p>This poor soul cried and was heard by Yahweh</p>
<p>and was saved from every trouble.</p>
<p>The angel of Yahweh encamps</p>
<p>around those who fear him and delivers them.</p>
<p>O taste and see that Yahweh is good;</p>
<p>happy are those who take refuge in him.</p>
<p>O fear Yahweh, you his holy ones,</p>
<p>for those who fear him have no want.</p>
<p>The young lions suffer want and hunger,</p>
<p>but those who seek Yahweh lack no good thing.</p>
<p>Come, O children, listen to me;</p>
<p>I will teach you the fear of Yahweh.</p>
<p>Which of you desires life</p>
<p>and covets many days to enjoy good?</p>
<p>Keep your tongue from evil</p>
<p>and your lips from speaking deceit.</p>
<p>Depart from evil, and do good;</p>
<p>seek peace, and pursue it.</p>
<p>The eyes of Yahweh are on the righteous,</p>
<p>and his ears are open to their cry.</p>
<p>The face of Yahweh is against evildoers,</p>
<p>to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>
<p>When the righteous cry for help, Yahweh hears</p>
<p>and rescues them from all their troubles.</p>
<p>Yahweh is near to the brokenhearted</p>
<p>and saves the crushed in spirit.</p>
<p>Many are the afflictions of the righteous,</p>
<p>but Yahweh rescues them from them all.</p>
<p>He keeps all their bones;</p>
<p>not one of them will be broken.</p>
<p>Evil brings death to the wicked,</p>
<p>and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.</p>
<p>Yahweh redeems the life of his servants;</p>
<p>none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.</p>
