<p>I love Yahweh because he has heard</p>
<p>my voice and my supplications.</p>
<p>Because he inclined his ear to me,</p>
<p>therefore I will call on him as long as I live.</p>
<p>The snares of death encompassed me;</p>
<p>the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me;</p>
<p>I suffered distress and anguish.</p>
<p>Then I called on the name of Yahweh,</p>
<p>“O Lord, I pray, save my life!”</p>
<p>Gracious is Yahweh and righteous;</p>
<p>our God is merciful.</p>
<p>Yahweh protects the simple;</p>
<p>when I was brought low, he saved me.</p>
<p>Return, O my soul, to your rest,</p>
<p>for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you.</p>
<p>For you have delivered my soul from death,</p>
<p>my eyes from tears,</p>
<p>my feet from stumbling.</p>
<p>I walk before Yahweh</p>
<p>in the land of the living.</p>
<p>I kept my faith, even when I said,</p>
<p>“I am greatly afflicted”;</p>
<p>I said in my consternation,</p>
<p>“Everyone is a liar.”</p>
<p>What shall I return to Yahweh</p>
<p>for all his bounty to me?</p>
<p>I will lift up the cup of salvation</p>
<p>and call on the name of Yahweh;</p>
<p>I will pay my vows to Yahweh</p>
<p>in the presence of all his people.</p>
<p>Precious in the sight of Yahweh</p>
<p>is the death of his faithful ones.</p>
<p>O Lord, I am your servant;</p>
<p>I am your servant, the child of your serving girl.</p>
<p>You have loosed my bonds.</p>
<p>I will offer to you a thanksgiving sacrifice</p>
<p>and call on the name of Yahweh.</p>
<p>I will pay my vows to Yahweh</p>
<p>in the presence of all his people,</p>
<p>in the courts of the house of Yahweh,</p>
<p>in your midst, O Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Praise Yahweh!</p>
