<p>Of David.</p>
<p>Do not fret because of the wicked;</p>
<p>do not be envious of wrongdoers,</p>
<p>for they will soon fade like the grass</p>
<p>and wither like the green herb.</p>
<p>Trust in Yahweh and do good;</p>
<p>live in the land and enjoy security.</p>
<p>Take delight in Yahweh,</p>
<p>and he will give you the desires of your heart.</p>
<p>Commit your way to Yahweh;</p>
<p>trust in him, and he will act.</p>
<p>He will make your vindication shine like the light</p>
<p>and the justice of your cause like the noonday.</p>
<p>Be still before Yahweh, and wait patiently for him;</p>
<p>do not fret over those who prosper in their way,</p>
<p>over those who carry out evil devices.</p>
<p>Refrain from anger and forsake wrath.</p>
<p>Do not fret—it leads only to evil.</p>
<p>For the wicked shall be cut off,</p>
<p>but those who wait for Yahweh shall inherit the land.</p>
<p>Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more;</p>
<p>though you look diligently for their place, they will not be there.</p>
<p>But the meek shall inherit the land</p>
<p>and delight themselves in abundant prosperity.</p>
<p>The wicked plot against the righteous</p>
<p>and gnash their teeth at them,</p>
<p>but Yahweh laughs at the wicked,</p>
<p>for he sees that their day is coming.</p>
<p>The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows</p>
<p>to bring down the poor and needy,</p>
<p>to kill those who walk uprightly;</p>
<p>their sword shall enter their own heart,</p>
<p>and their bows shall be broken.</p>
<p>Better is a little that the righteous person has</p>
<p>than the abundance of many wicked.</p>
<p>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,</p>
<p>but Yahweh upholds the righteous.</p>
<p>Yahweh knows the days of the blameless,</p>
<p>and their heritage will abide forever;</p>
<p>they are not put to shame in evil times;</p>
<p>in the days of famine they have abundance.</p>
<p>But the wicked perish,</p>
<p>and the enemies of Yahweh are like the glory of the pastures;</p>
<p>they vanish—like smoke they vanish away.</p>
<p>The wicked borrow and do not pay back,</p>
<p>but the righteous are generous and keep giving;</p>
<p>surely those blessed by Yahweh shall inherit the land,</p>
<p>but those cursed by him shall be cut off.</p>
<p>Our steps are made firm by Yahweh</p>
<p>when he delights in our way;</p>
<p>though we stumble, we shall not fall headlong,</p>
<p>for Yahweh holds us by the hand.</p>
<p>I have been young and now am old,</p>
<p>yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken</p>
<p>or their children begging bread.</p>
<p>They are ever giving liberally and lending,</p>
<p>and their children become a blessing.</p>
<p>Depart from evil, and do good;</p>
<p>so you shall abide forever.</p>
<p>For Yahweh loves justice;</p>
<p>he will not forsake his faithful ones.</p>
<p>The righteous shall be kept safe forever,</p>
<p>but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
<p>The righteous shall inherit the land</p>
<p>and live in it forever.</p>
<p>The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom,</p>
<p>and their tongues speak justice.</p>
<p>The law of their God is in their hearts;</p>
<p>their steps do not slip.</p>
<p>The wicked watch for the righteous</p>
<p>and seek to kill them.</p>
<p>Yahweh will not abandon them to their power</p>
<p>or let them be condemned when they are brought to trial.</p>
<p>Wait for Yahweh and keep to his way,</p>
<p>and he will exalt you to inherit the land;</p>
<p>you will look on the destruction of the wicked.</p>
<p>I have seen the wicked oppressing</p>
<p>and towering like a cedar of Lebanon.</p>
<p>Again I passed by, and they were no more;</p>
<p>though I sought them, they could not be found.</p>
<p>Mark the blameless and behold the upright,</p>
<p>for there is posterity for the peaceable.</p>
<p>But transgressors shall be altogether destroyed;</p>
<p>the posterity of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
<p>The salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh;</p>
<p>he is their refuge in the time of trouble.</p>
<p>Yahweh helps them and rescues them;</p>
<p>he rescues them from the wicked and saves them</p>
<p>because they take refuge in him.</p>
