<p>To the leader. Of David, the servant of Yahweh.</p>
<p>Transgression speaks to the wicked</p>
<p>deep in their hearts;</p>
<p>there is no fear of God</p>
<p>before their eyes.</p>
<p>For they flatter themselves in their own eyes</p>
<p>that their iniquity cannot be found out and hated.</p>
<p>The words of their mouths are mischief and deceit;</p>
<p>they have ceased to act wisely and do good.</p>
<p>They plot mischief while on their beds;</p>
<p>they are set on a way that is not good;</p>
<p>they do not reject evil.</p>
<p>Your steadfast love, O Lord, extends to the heavens,</p>
<p>your faithfulness to the clouds.</p>
<p>Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains;</p>
<p>your judgments are like the great deep;</p>
<p>you save humans and animals alike, O Lord.</p>
<p>How precious is your steadfast love, O God!</p>
<p>All people may take refuge in the shadow of your wings.</p>
<p>They feast on the abundance of your house,</p>
<p>and you give them drink from the river of your delights.</p>
<p>For with you is the fountain of life;</p>
<p>in your light we see light.</p>
<p>O continue your steadfast love to those who know you</p>
<p>and your salvation to the upright of heart!</p>
<p>Do not let the foot of the arrogant tread on me</p>
<p>or the hand of the wicked drive me away.</p>
<p>There the evildoers lie prostrate;</p>
<p>they are thrust down, unable to rise.</p>
