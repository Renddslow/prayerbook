<p>Of David. A Maskil.</p>
<p>Happy are those whose transgression is forgiven,</p>
<p>whose sin is covered.</p>
<p>Happy are those to whom the Lord imputes no iniquity</p>
<p>and in whose spirit there is no deceit.</p>
<p>While I kept silent, my body wasted away</p>
<p>through my groaning all day long.</p>
<p>For day and night your hand was heavy upon me;</p>
<p>my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. Selah</p>
<p>Then I acknowledged my sin to you,</p>
<p>and I did not hide my iniquity;</p>
<p>I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,”</p>
<p>and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah</p>
<p>Therefore let all who are faithful</p>
<p>offer prayer to you;</p>
<p>at a time of distress, the rush of mighty waters</p>
<p>shall not reach them.</p>
<p>You are a hiding place for me;</p>
<p>you preserve me from trouble;</p>
<p>you surround me with glad cries of deliverance. Selah</p>
<p>I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go;</p>
<p>I will counsel you with my eye upon you.</p>
<p>Do not be like a horse or a mule, without understanding,</p>
<p>whose temper must be curbed with bit and bridle,</p>
<p>else it will not stay near you.</p>
<p>Many are the torments of the wicked,</p>
<p>but steadfast love surrounds those who trust in the Lord.</p>
<p>Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, O righteous,</p>
<p>and shout for joy, all you upright in heart.</p>
