<p>To the leader. A Psalm of David.</p>
<p>In your strength the king rejoices, O Lord,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and in your help how greatly he exults!</p>
<p>You have given him his heart’s desire</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah</p>
<p>For you meet him with rich blessings;</p>
<p class="pb-indent">you set a crown of fine gold on his head.</p>
<p>He asked you for life; you gave it to him—</p>
<p class="pb-indent">length of days forever and ever.</p>
<p>His glory is great through your help;</p>
<p class="pb-indent">splendor and majesty you bestow on him.</p>
<p>You bestow on him blessings forever;</p>
<p class="pb-indent">you make him glad with the joy of your presence.</p>
<p>For the king trusts in Yahweh,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">
  and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved.
</p>
<p>Your hand will find out all your enemies;</p>
<p class="pb-indent">your right hand will find out those who hate you.</p>
<p>You will make them like a fiery furnace</p>
<p class="pb-indent">when you appear.</p>
<p>Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and fire will consume them.</p>
<p>You will destroy their offspring from the earth</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and their children from among humankind.</p>
<p>If they plan evil against you,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">if they devise mischief, they will not succeed.</p>
<p>For you will put them to flight;</p>
<p class="pb-indent">you will aim at their faces with your bows.</p>
<p>Be exalted, O Lord, in your strength!</p>
<p class="pb-indent">We will sing and praise your power.</p>
