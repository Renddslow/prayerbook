<p>To the leader. A Psalm of David.</p>
<p>The Lord answer you in the day of trouble!</p>
<p class="pb-indent">The name of the God of Jacob protect you!</p>
<p>May he send you help from the sanctuary</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and give you support from Zion.</p>
<p>May he remember all your offerings</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices. Selah</p>
<p>May he grant you your heartâ€™s desire</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and fulfill all your plans.</p>
<p>May we shout for joy over your victory</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and in the name of our God set up our banners.</p>
<p>May the Lord fulfill all your petitions.</p>
<p>Now I know that the Lord will help his anointed;</p>
<p class="pb-indent">he will answer him from his holy heaven</p>
<p class="pb-indent">with mighty victories by his right hand.</p>
<p>Some take pride in chariots and some in horses,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">but our pride is in the name of the Lord our God.</p>
<p>They will collapse and fall,</p>
<p class="pb-indent">but we shall rise and stand upright.</p>
<p>Give victory to the king, O Lord;</p>
<p class="pb-indent">answer us when we call.</p>
