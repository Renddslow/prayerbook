<p>To the leader: to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.</p>
<p>I said, “I will guard my ways</p>
<p>that I may not sin with my tongue;</p>
<p>I will keep a muzzle on my mouth</p>
<p>as long as the wicked are in my presence.”</p>
<p>I was silent and still;</p>
<p>I held my peace to no avail;</p>
<p>my distress grew worse;</p>
<p>my heart became hot within me.</p>
<p>While I mused, the fire burned;</p>
<p>then I spoke with my tongue:</p>
<p>“Lord, let me know my end</p>
<p>and what is the measure of my days;</p>
<p>let me know how fleeting my life is.</p>
<p>You have made my days a few handbreadths,</p>
<p>and my lifetime is as nothing in your sight.</p>
<p>Surely everyone stands as a mere breath. Selah</p>
<p>Surely everyone goes about like a shadow.</p>
<p>Surely for nothing they are in turmoil;</p>
<p>they heap up and do not know who will gather.</p>
<p>“And now, O Lord, what do I wait for?</p>
<p>My hope is in you.</p>
<p>Deliver me from all my transgressions.</p>
<p>Do not make me the scorn of the fool.</p>
<p>I am silent; I do not open my mouth,</p>
<p>for it is you who have done it.</p>
<p>Remove your stroke from me;</p>
<p>I am worn down by the blows of your hand.</p>
<p>“You chastise mortals</p>
<p>in punishment for sin,</p>
<p>consuming like a moth what is dear to them;</p>
<p>surely everyone is a mere breath. Selah</p>
<p>“Hear my prayer, O Lord,</p>
<p>and give ear to my cry;</p>
<p>do not hold your peace at my tears.</p>
<p>For I am your passing guest,</p>
<p>an alien, like all my forebears.</p>
<p>Turn your gaze away from me, that I may smile again,</p>
<p>before I depart and am no more.”</p>
