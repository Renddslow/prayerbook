<p>To the leader: according to Lilies. Of David.</p>
<p>Save me, O God,</p>
<p>for the waters have come up to my neck.</p>
<p>I sink in deep mire,</p>
<p>where there is no foothold;</p>
<p>I have come into deep waters,</p>
<p>and the flood sweeps over me.</p>
<p>I am weary with my crying;</p>
<p>my throat is parched.</p>
<p>My eyes grow dim</p>
<p>with waiting for my God.</p>
<p>More in number than the hairs of my head</p>
<p>are those who hate me without cause;</p>
<p>many are those who would destroy me,</p>
<p>my enemies who accuse me falsely.</p>
<p>What I did not steal,</p>
<p>must I now restore?</p>
<p>O God, you know my folly;</p>
<p>the wrongs I have done are not hidden from you.</p>
<p>Do not let those who hope in you be put to shame because of me,</p>
<p>O Lord God of hosts;</p>
<p>do not let those who seek you be dishonored because of me,</p>
<p>O God of Israel.</p>
<p>It is for your sake that I have borne reproach,</p>
<p>that shame has covered my face.</p>
<p>I have become a stranger to my kindred,</p>
<p>an alien to my mother’s children.</p>
<p>It is zeal for your house that has consumed me;</p>
<p>the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.</p>
<p>When I humbled my soul with fasting,</p>
<p>they insulted me for doing so.</p>
<p>When I made sackcloth my clothing,</p>
<p>I became a byword to them.</p>
<p>I am the subject of gossip for those who sit in the gate,</p>
<p>and the drunkards make songs about me.</p>
<p>But as for me, my prayer is to you, O Lord.</p>
<p>At an acceptable time, O God,</p>
<p>in the abundance of your steadfast love, answer me.</p>
<p>With your faithful help rescue me</p>
<p>from sinking in the mire;</p>
<p>let me be delivered from my enemies</p>
<p>and from the deep waters.</p>
<p>Do not let the flood sweep over me</p>
<p>or the deep swallow me up</p>
<p>or the Pit close its mouth over me.</p>
<p>Answer me, O Lord, for your steadfast love is good;</p>
<p>according to your abundant mercy, turn to me.</p>
<p>Do not hide your face from your servant,</p>
<p>for I am in distress—make haste to answer me.</p>
<p>Draw near to me; redeem me;</p>
<p>set me free because of my enemies.</p>
<p>You know the insults I receive</p>
<p>and my shame and dishonor;</p>
<p>my foes are all known to you.</p>
<p>Insults have broken my heart,</p>
<p>so that I am in despair.</p>
<p>I looked for pity, but there was none;</p>
<p>and for comforters, but I found none.</p>
<p>They gave me poison for food,</p>
<p>and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>
<p>Let their table be a trap for them,</p>
<p>a snare for their allies.</p>
<p>Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,</p>
<p>and make their loins tremble continually.</p>
<p>Pour out your indignation upon them,</p>
<p>and let your burning anger overtake them.</p>
<p>May their camp be a desolation;</p>
<p>let no one live in their tents.</p>
<p>For they persecute those whom you have struck down,</p>
<p>and those whom you have wounded they attack still more.</p>
<p>Add guilt to their guilt;</p>
<p>may they have no acquittal from you.</p>
<p>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living;</p>
<p>let them not be enrolled among the righteous.</p>
<p>But I am lowly and in pain;</p>
<p>let your salvation, O God, protect me.</p>
<p>I will praise the name of God with a song;</p>
<p>I will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>
<p>This will please Yahweh more than an ox</p>
<p>or a bull with horns and hoofs.</p>
<p>Let the oppressed see it and be glad;</p>
<p>you who seek God, let your hearts revive.</p>
<p>For Yahweh hears the needy</p>
<p>and does not despise his own who are in bonds.</p>
<p>Let heaven and earth praise him,</p>
<p>the seas and everything that moves in them.</p>
<p>For God will save Zion</p>
<p>and rebuild the cities of Judah,</p>
<p>and his servants shall live there and possess it;</p>
<p>the children of his servants shall inherit it,</p>
<p>and those who love his name shall live in it.</p>
