<p>Of David.</p>
<p>To you, O Lord, I call;</p>
<p>my rock, do not refuse to hear me,</p>
<p>for if you are silent to me,</p>
<p>I shall be like those who go down to the Pit.</p>
<p>Hear the voice of my supplication,</p>
<p>as I cry to you for help,</p>
<p>as I lift up my hands</p>
<p>toward your most holy sanctuary.</p>
<p>Do not drag me away with the wicked,</p>
<p>with those who are workers of evil,</p>
<p>who speak peace with their neighbors</p>
<p>while mischief is in their hearts.</p>
<p>Repay them according to their work</p>
<p>and according to the evil of their deeds;</p>
<p>repay them according to the work of their hands;</p>
<p>render them their due reward.</p>
<p>Because they do not regard the works of Yahweh</p>
<p>or the work of his hands,</p>
<p>he will break them down and build them up no more.</p>
<p>Blessed be Yahweh,</p>
<p>for he has heard the sound of my pleadings.</p>
<p>Yahweh is my strength and my shield;</p>
<p>in him my heart trusts;</p>
<p>so I am helped, and my heart exults,</p>
<p>and with my song I give thanks to him.</p>
<p>Yahweh is the strength of his people;</p>
<p>he is the saving refuge of his anointed.</p>
<p>O save your people and bless your heritage;</p>
<p>be their shepherd and carry them forever.</p>
