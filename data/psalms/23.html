<p>A Psalm of David.</p>
<p>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.</p>
<p>He makes me lie down in green pastures;</p>
<p>he leads me beside still waters;</p>
<p>he restores my soul.</p>
<p>He leads me in right paths</p>
<p>for his nameâ€™s sake.</p>
<p>Even though I walk through the darkest valley,</p>
<p>I fear no evil,</p>
<p>for you are with me;</p>
<p>your rod and your staff,</p>
<p>they comfort me.</p>
<p>You prepare a table before me</p>
<p>in the presence of my enemies;</p>
<p>you anoint my head with oil;</p>
<p>my cup overflows.</p>
<p>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me</p>
<p>all the days of my life,</p>
<p>and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord</p>
<p>my whole life long.</p>
