<p>In you, O Lord, I take refuge;</p>
<p>let me never be put to shame.</p>
<p>In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me;</p>
<p>incline your ear to me and save me.</p>
<p>Be to me a rock of refuge,</p>
<p>a strong fortress to save me,</p>
<p>for you are my rock and my fortress.</p>
<p>Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked,</p>
<p>from the grasp of the unjust and cruel.</p>
<p>For you, O Lord, are my hope,</p>
<p>my trust, O Lord, from my youth.</p>
<p>From my birth I have leaned upon you,</p>
<p>my protector since my mother’s womb.</p>
<p>My praise is continually of you.</p>
<p>I have been like a portent to many,</p>
<p>but you are my strong refuge.</p>
<p>My mouth is filled with your praise</p>
<p>and with your glory all day long.</p>
<p>Do not cast me off in the time of old age;</p>
<p>do not forsake me when my strength is spent.</p>
<p>For my enemies speak concerning me,</p>
<p>and those who watch for my life consult together.</p>
<p>They say, “Pursue and seize that person</p>
<p>whom God has forsaken,</p>
<p>for there is no one to deliver.”</p>
<p>O God, do not be far from me;</p>
<p>O my God, make haste to help me!</p>
<p>Let my accusers be put to shame and consumed;</p>
<p>let those who seek to hurt me</p>
<p>be covered with scorn and disgrace.</p>
<p>But I will hope continually</p>
<p>and will praise you yet more and more.</p>
<p>My mouth will tell of your righteous acts,</p>
<p>of your deeds of salvation all day long,</p>
<p>though their number is past my knowledge.</p>
<p>I will come praising the mighty deeds of the Lord God;</p>
<p>I will praise your righteousness, yours alone.</p>
<p>O God, from my youth you have taught me,</p>
<p>and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds.</p>
<p>So even to old age and gray hairs,</p>
<p>O God, do not forsake me,</p>
<p>until I proclaim your might</p>
<p>to all the generations to come.</p>
<p>Your power and your righteousness, O God,</p>
<p>reach the high heavens.</p>
<p>You who have done great things,</p>
<p>O God, who is like you?</p>
<p>You who have made me see many troubles and calamities</p>
<p>will revive me again;</p>
<p>from the depths of the earth</p>
<p>you will bring me up again.</p>
<p>You will increase my honor</p>
<p>and comfort me once again.</p>
<p>I will also praise you with the harp</p>
<p>for your faithfulness, O my God;</p>
<p>I will sing praises to you with the lyre,</p>
<p>O Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>My lips will shout for joy</p>
<p>when I sing praises to you;</p>
<p>my soul also, which you have rescued.</p>
<p>All day long my tongue will talk of your righteous help,</p>
<p>for those who tried to do me harm</p>
<p>have been put to shame and disgraced.</p>
