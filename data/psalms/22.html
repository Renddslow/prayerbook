<p>To the leader: according to The Deer of the Dawn. A Psalm of David.</p>
<p>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</p>
<p>Why are you so far from helping me, from the words of my groaning?</p>
<p>O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer;</p>
<p>and by night but find no rest.</p>
<p>Yet you are holy,</p>
<p>enthroned on the praises of Israel.</p>
<p>In you our ancestors trusted;</p>
<p>they trusted, and you delivered them.</p>
<p>To you they cried and were saved;</p>
<p>in you they trusted and were not put to shame.</p>
<p>But I am a worm and not human,</p>
<p>scorned by others and despised by the people.</p>
<p>All who see me mock me;</p>
<p>they sneer at me; they shake their heads;</p>
<p>“Commit your cause to Yahweh; let him deliver—</p>
<p>let him rescue the one in whom he delights!”</p>
<p>Yet it was you who took me from the womb;</p>
<p>you kept me safe on my mother’s breast.</p>
<p>On you I was cast from my birth,</p>
<p>and since my mother bore me you have been my God.</p>
<p>Do not be far from me,</p>
<p>for trouble is near,</p>
<p>and there is no one to help.</p>
<p>Many bulls encircle me;</p>
<p>strong bulls of Bashan surround me;</p>
<p>they open wide their mouths at me,</p>
<p>like a ravening and roaring lion.</p>
<p>I am poured out like water,</p>
<p>and all my bones are out of joint;</p>
<p>my heart is like wax;</p>
<p>it is melted within my breast;</p>
<p>my mouth is dried up like a potsherd,</p>
<p>and my tongue sticks to my jaws;</p>
<p>you lay me in the dust of death.</p>
<p>For dogs are all around me;</p>
<p>a company of evildoers encircles me;</p>
<p>they bound my hands and feet.</p>
<p>I can count all my bones.</p>
<p>They stare and gloat over me;</p>
<p>they divide my clothes among themselves,</p>
<p>and for my clothing they cast lots.</p>
<p>But you, O Lord, do not be far away!</p>
<p>O my help, come quickly to my aid!</p>
<p>Deliver my soul from the sword,</p>
<p>my life from the power of the dog!</p>
<p>Save me from the mouth of the lion!</p>
<p>From the horns of the wild oxen you have rescued me.</p>
<p>I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters;</p>
<p>in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:</p>
<p>You who fear Yahweh, praise him!</p>
<p>All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him;</p>
<p>stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!</p>
<p>For he did not despise or abhor</p>
<p>the affliction of the afflicted;</p>
<p>he did not hide his face from me</p>
<p>but heard when I cried to him.</p>
<p>From you comes my praise in the great congregation;</p>
<p>my vows I will pay before those who fear him.</p>
<p>The poor shall eat and be satisfied;</p>
<p>those who seek him shall praise Yahweh.</p>
<p>May your hearts live forever!</p>
<p>All the ends of the earth shall remember</p>
<p>and turn to Yahweh,</p>
<p>and all the families of the nations</p>
<p>shall worship before him.</p>
<p>For dominion belongs to Yahweh,</p>
<p>and he rules over the nations.</p>
<p>To him, indeed, shall all who sleep in the earth bow down;</p>
<p>before him shall bow all who go down to the dust,</p>
<p>and I shall live for him.</p>
<p>Posterity will serve him;</p>
<p>future generations will be told about Yahweh</p>
<p>and proclaim his deliverance to a people yet unborn,</p>
<p>saying that he has done it.</p>
