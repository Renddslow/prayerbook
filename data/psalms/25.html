<p>Of David.</p>
<p>To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.</p>
<p>O my God, in you I trust;</p>
<p>do not let me be put to shame;</p>
<p>do not let my enemies exult over me.</p>
<p>Do not let those who wait for you be put to shame;</p>
<p>let them be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous.</p>
<p>Make me to know your ways, O Lord;</p>
<p>teach me your paths.</p>
<p>Lead me in your truth and teach me,</p>
<p>for you are the God of my salvation;</p>
<p>for you I wait all day long.</p>
<p>Be mindful of your mercy, O Lord, and of your steadfast love,</p>
<p>for they have been from of old.</p>
<p>Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions;</p>
<p>according to your steadfast love remember me,</p>
<p>for the sake of your goodness, O Lord!</p>
<p>Good and upright is Yahweh;</p>
<p>therefore he instructs sinners in the way.</p>
<p>He leads the humble in what is right</p>
<p>and teaches the humble his way.</p>
<p>All the paths of Yahweh are steadfast love and faithfulness,</p>
<p>for those who keep his covenant and his decrees.</p>
<p>For your nameâ€™s sake, O Lord,</p>
<p>pardon my guilt, for it is great.</p>
<p>Who are they who fear Yahweh?</p>
<p>He will teach them the way that they should choose.</p>
<p>They will abide in prosperity,</p>
<p>and their children shall possess the land.</p>
<p>The friendship of Yahweh is for those who fear him,</p>
<p>and he makes his covenant known to them.</p>
<p>My eyes are ever toward Yahweh,</p>
<p>for he will pluck my feet out of the net.</p>
<p>Turn to me and be gracious to me,</p>
<p>for I am lonely and afflicted.</p>
<p>Relieve the troubles of my heart,</p>
<p>and bring me out of my distress.</p>
<p>Consider my affliction and my trouble,</p>
<p>and forgive all my sins.</p>
<p>Consider how many are my foes</p>
<p>and with what violent hatred they hate me.</p>
<p>O guard my life and deliver me;</p>
<p>do not let me be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.</p>
<p>May integrity and uprightness preserve me,</p>
<p>for I wait for you.</p>
<p>Redeem Israel, O God,</p>
<p>out of all its troubles.</p>
