  Yahweh said to Moses, “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If a man or
  woman wants to make a special vow, a vow of dedication to Yahweh as a
  Nazirite, they must abstain from wine and other fermented drink and must not
  drink vinegar made from wine or other fermented drink. They must not drink
  grape juice or eat grapes or raisins. As long as they remain under their
  Nazirite vow, they must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, not
  even the seeds or skins.
</p>

<p>
  “‘During the entire period of their Nazirite vow, no razor may be used on
  their head. They must be holy until the period of their dedication to Yahweh
  is over; they must let their hair grow long.
</p>

<p>
  “‘Throughout the period of their dedication to Yahweh, the Nazirite must not
  go near a dead body. Even if their own father or mother or brother or sister
  dies, they must not make themselves ceremonially unclean on account of them,
  because the symbol of their dedication to God is on their head. Throughout the
  period of their dedication, they are consecrated to Yahweh.
</p>

<p>
  “‘If someone dies suddenly in the Nazirite’s presence, thus defiling the hair
  that symbolizes their dedication, they must shave their head on the seventh
  day—the day of their cleansing. Then on the eighth day they must bring two
  doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of
  meeting. The priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt
  offering to make atonement for the Nazirite because they sinned by being in
  the presence of the dead body. That same day they are to consecrate their head
  again. They must rededicate themselves to Yahweh for the same period of
  dedication and must bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. The
  previous days do not count, because they became defiled during their period of
  dedication.
</p>

<p>
  “‘Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the period of their dedication is
  over. They are to be brought to the entrance to the tent of meeting. There
  they are to present their offerings to Yahweh: a year-old male lamb without
  defect for a burnt offering, a year-old ewe lamb without defect for a sin
  offering, a ram without defect for a fellowship offering, together with their
  grain offerings and drink offerings, and a basket of bread made with the
  finest flour and without yeast—thick loaves with olive oil mixed in, and thin
  loaves brushed with olive oil.
</p>

<p>
  “‘The priest is to present all these before Yahweh and make the sin offering
  and the burnt offering. He is to present the basket of unleavened bread and is
  to sacrifice the ram as a fellowship offering to Yahweh, together with its
  grain offering and drink offering.
</p>

<p>
  “‘Then at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the Nazirite must shave off the
  hair that symbolizes their dedication. They are to take the hair and put it in
  the fire that is under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering.
</p>

<p>
  “‘After the Nazirite has shaved off the hair that symbolizes their dedication,
  the priest is to place in their hands a boiled shoulder of the ram, and one
  thick loaf and one thin loaf from the basket, both made without yeast. The
  priest shall then wave these before Yahweh as a wave offering; they are holy
  and belong to the priest, together with the breast that was waved and the
  thigh that was presented. After that, the Nazirite may drink wine.
</p>

<p>
  “‘This is the law of the Nazirite who vows offerings to Yahweh in accordance
  with their dedication, in addition to whatever else they can afford. They must
  fulfill the vows they have made, according to the law of the Nazirite.’”
</p>

<p>
  Yahweh said to Moses, “Tell Aaron and his sons, ‘This is how you are to bless
  the Israelites. Say to them:
</p>

<p>“‘“Yahweh bless you</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and keep you;</p>
<p>Yahweh make his face shine on you</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and be gracious to you;</p>
<p>Yahweh turn his face toward you</p>
<p class="pb-indent">and give you peace.”’</p>

<p>“So they will put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.”</p>
