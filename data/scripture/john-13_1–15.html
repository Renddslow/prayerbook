  Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to
  depart from this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in
  the world, he loved them to the end. The devil had already decided that Judas
  son of Simon Iscariot would betray Jesus. And during supper Jesus, knowing
  that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from
  God and was going to God, got up from supper, took off his outer robe, and
  tied a towel around himself. Then he poured water into a basin and began to
  wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around
  him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my
  feet?” Jesus answered, “You do not know now what I am doing, but later you
  will understand.” Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus
  answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to
  him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to
  him, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is
  entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” For he knew who was
  to betray him; for this reason he said, “Not all of you are clean.”

  After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had reclined again,
  he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and
  Lord, and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and
  Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For
  I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.
