  Now Korah son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram
  sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth son of Reuben, took two hundred fifty
  Israelite men, leaders of the congregation, chosen from the assembly,
  well-known men, and they confronted Moses. They assembled against Moses and
  against Aaron and said to them, “You have gone too far! All the congregation
  are holy, every one of them, and Yahweh is among them. So why then do you
  exalt yourselves above the assembly of Yahweh?” When Moses heard it, he fell
  on his face. Then he spoke to Korah and all his congregation, saying, “In the
  morning Yahweh will make known who is his and who is holy and who will be
  allowed to approach him; the one whom he will choose he will allow to approach
  him. Do this: take censers, Korah and all your congregation, and tomorrow put
  fire in them, and lay incense on them before Yahweh, and the man whom the Lord
  chooses shall be the holy one. You Levites have gone too far!” Then Moses said
  to Korah, “Hear now, you Levites! Is it too little for you that the God of
  Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel to allow you to
  approach him in order to perform the duties of Yahweh’s tabernacle and to
  stand before the congregation and serve them? He has allowed you to approach
  him, and all your brother Levites with you, yet you seek the priesthood as
  well! Therefore you and all your congregation have gathered together against
  Yahweh. What is Aaron that you rail against him?”

  Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not
  come! Is it too little that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with
  milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, that you must also lord it over
  us? It is clear you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and
  honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you put out
  the eyes of these men? We will not come!”

  Moses was very angry and said to Yahweh, “Pay no attention to their offering.
  I have not taken one donkey from them, and I have not harmed any one of them.”
  And Moses said to Korah, “As for you and all your congregation, be present
  tomorrow before Yahweh, you and they and Aaron, and let each one of you take
  his censer and put incense on it and each one of you present his censer before
  Yahweh, two hundred fifty censers, you also, and Aaron, each his censer.” So
  each man took his censer, and they put fire in the censers and laid incense on
  them, and they stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and
  Aaron. Then Korah assembled the whole congregation against them at the
  entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of Yahweh appeared to the whole
  congregation.
