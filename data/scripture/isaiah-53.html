<p>Who has believed what we have heard?</p>
<p>And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</p>
<p>For he grew up before him like a young plant</p>
<p>and like a root out of dry ground;</p>
<p>he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,</p>
<p>nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.</p>
<p>He was despised and rejected by others;</p>
<p>a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity,</p>
<p>and as one from whom others hide their faces</p>
<p>he was despised, and we held him of no account.</p>
<p>Surely he has borne our infirmities</p>
<p>and carried our diseases,</p>
<p>yet we accounted him stricken,</p>
<p>struck down by God, and afflicted.</p>
<p>But he was wounded for our transgressions,</p>
<p>crushed for our iniquities;</p>
<p>upon him was the punishment that made us whole,</p>
<p>and by his bruises we are healed.</p>
<p>All we like sheep have gone astray;</p>
<p>we have all turned to our own way,</p>
<p>and the Lord has laid on him</p>
<p>the iniquity of us all.</p>
<p>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,</p>
<p>yet he did not open his mouth;</p>
<p>like a lamb that is led to the slaughter</p>
<p>and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,</p>
<p>so he did not open his mouth.</p>
<p>By a perversion of justice he was taken away.</p>
<p>Who could have imagined his future?</p>
<p>For he was cut off from the land of the living,</p>
<p>stricken for the transgression of my people.</p>
<p>They made his grave with the wicked</p>
<p>and his tomb with the rich,</p>
<p>although he had done no violence,</p>
<p>and there was no deceit in his mouth.</p>
<p>Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him with affliction.</p>
<p>When you make his life an offering for sin,</p>
<p>he shall see his offspring and shall prolong his days;</p>
<p>through him the will of the Lord shall prosper.</p>
<p>Out of his anguish he shall see;</p>
<p>he shall find satisfaction through his knowledge.</p>
<p>The righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous,</p>
<p>and he shall bear their iniquities.</p>
<p>Therefore I will allot him a portion with the great,</p>
<p>and he shall divide the spoil with the strong,</p>
<p>because he poured out himself to death</p>
<p>and was numbered with the transgressors,</p>
<p>yet he bore the sin of many</p>
<p>and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>
