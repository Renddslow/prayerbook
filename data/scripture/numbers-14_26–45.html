  And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, “How long shall this wicked
  congregation complain against me? I have heard the complaints of the
  Israelites, which they complain against me. Say to them, ‘As I live,’ says the
  Lord, ‘I will do to you the very things I heard you say: your dead bodies
  shall fall in this very wilderness, and of all your number included in the
  census from twenty years old and up who have complained against me, not one of
  you shall come into the land in which I swore to settle you, except Caleb son
  of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. But your little ones, who you said would
  become plunder, I will bring in, and they shall know the land that you have
  despised. But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. And
  your children shall be shepherds in the wilderness for forty years and shall
  suffer for your faithlessness, until the last of your dead bodies lies in the
  wilderness. According to the number of the days in which you spied out the
  land, forty days, for every day a year, you shall bear your iniquity, forty
  years, and you shall know my displeasure.’ I Yahweh have spoken; surely I will
  do thus to all this wicked congregation gathered together against me: in this
  wilderness they shall come to a full end, and there they shall die.”

  And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land who returned and made all the
  congregation complain against him by bringing a bad report about the land, the
  men who brought an unfavorable report about the land died by a plague before
  Yahweh. But Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh alone remained alive,
  of those men who went to spy out the land.

  When Moses told these words to all the Israelites, the people mourned greatly.
  They rose early in the morning and went up to the heights of the hill country,
  saying, “Here we are. We will go up to the place that Yahweh has promised, for
  we have sinned.” But Moses said, “Why do you continue to transgress the
  command of Yahweh? That will not succeed. Do not go up, for Yahweh is not with
  you; do not let yourselves be struck down before your enemies. For the
  Amalekites and the Canaanites will confront you there, and you shall fall by
  the sword; because you have turned back from following Yahweh, Yahweh will not
  be with you.” But they presumed to go up to the heights of the hill country,
  even though the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and Moses had not left the camp.
  Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came
  down and defeated them, pursuing them as far as Hormah.
