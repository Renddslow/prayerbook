  Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, “Separate yourselves from
  this congregation, so that I may consume them in a moment.” They fell on their
  faces and said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one person
  sin and you become angry with the whole congregation?”
</p>

<p>
  And Yahweh spoke to Moses: “Speak to the congregation, saying: Get away from
  the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.” So Moses got up and went to
  Dathan and Abiram; the elders of Israel followed him. He spoke to the
  congregation, saying, “Turn away from the tents of these wicked men and touch
  nothing of theirs, or you will be swept away for all their sins.” So they got
  away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and Dathan and Abiram
  came out and stood at the entrances of their tents, together with their wives,
  their children, and their little ones. And Moses said, “This is how you shall
  know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; it has not been of my own
  accord: If these people die a natural death or if a natural fate comes on
  them, then Yahweh has not sent me. But if Yahweh creates something new and the
  ground opens its mouth and swallows them up, with all that belongs to them,
  and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall know that these men have
  despised Yahweh.”

<p>
  As soon as he finished speaking all these words, the ground under them was
  split apart. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, along with
  their households—everyone who belonged to Korah and all their goods. So they
  with all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol; the earth closed
  over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly. All Israel around
  them fled at their outcry, for they said, “The earth will swallow us, too!”
  And fire came out from Yahweh and consumed the two hundred fifty men offering
  the incense.

<p>
  Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, “Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to
  take the censers out of the blaze, then scatter the fire far and wide. For the
  censers of these sinners have become holy at the cost of their lives. Make
  them into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, for they presented them
  before Yahweh and they became holy. Thus they shall be a sign to the
  Israelites.” So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that had been
  presented by those who were burned, and they were hammered out as a covering
  for the altar— a reminder to the Israelites that no outsider, who is not of
  the descendants of Aaron, shall approach to offer incense before Yahweh, so as
  not to become like Korah and his congregation, just as Yahweh had said to him
  through Moses.

  On the next day, however, the whole congregation of the Israelites rebelled
  against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of the
  Lord.” And when the congregation had assembled against them, Moses and Aaron
  turned toward the tent of meeting; the cloud had covered it, and the glory of
  Yahweh appeared. Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of
  meeting, and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, “Get away from this congregation,
  so that I may consume them in a moment.” And they fell on their faces. Moses
  said to Aaron, “Take your censer, put fire on it from the altar and lay
  incense on it and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for
  them. For wrath has gone out from Yahweh; the plague has begun.” So Aaron took
  it as Moses had ordered and ran into the middle of the assembly, where the
  plague had already begun among the people. He put on the incense and made
  atonement for the people. He stood between the dead and the living, and the
  plague was stopped. Those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven
  hundred, besides those who died in the affair of Korah. When the plague was
  stopped, Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
