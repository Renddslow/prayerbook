  While they were at Hazeroth, Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of
  the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had indeed married a Cushite
  woman), and they said, “Has Yahweh spoken only through Moses? Has he not
  spoken through us also?” And Yahweh heard it. Now the man Moses was very
  humble, more so than anyone else on the face of the earth. Suddenly Yahweh
  said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “Come out, you three, to the tent of
  meeting.” So the three of them came out. Then Yahweh came down in a pillar of
  cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and
  they both came forward. And he said, “Hear my words:
</p>

<p>When there are prophets among you,</p>
<p>I Yahweh make myself known to them in visions;</p>
<p>I speak to them in dreams.</p>
<p>Not so with my servant Moses;</p>
<p>he is faithful in all my house.</p>
<p>With him I speak face to face—clearly, not in riddles,</p>
<p>and he beholds the form of Yahweh.</p>

<p>
  “Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?” And the
  anger of Yahweh was kindled against them, and he departed.

  When the cloud went away from over the tent, Miriam’s skin had become
  diseased, as white as snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam and saw that she
  was diseased. Then Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, do not punish us for a
  sin that we have so foolishly committed. Do not let her be like one stillborn,
  whose flesh is half consumed when it comes out of its mother’s womb.” And
  Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “O God, please heal her.” But Yahweh said to
  Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not bear her shame
  for seven days? Let her be shut out of the camp for seven days, and after that
  she may be brought in again.” So Miriam was shut out of the camp for seven
  days, and the people did not set out on the march until Miriam had been
  brought in again. After that the people set out from Hazeroth and camped in
  the wilderness of Paran.
