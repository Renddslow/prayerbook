<p>An Oracle.</p>
<p>The word of the Lord is against the land of Hadrach</p>
<p>and will rest upon Damascus.</p>
<p>For to the Lord belongs the capital of Aram,</p>
<p>as do all the tribes of Israel;</p>
<p>Hamath also, which borders on it,</p>
<p>Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.</p>
<p>Tyre has built itself a rampart</p>
<p>and heaped up silver like dust</p>
<p>and gold like the dirt of the streets.</p>
<p>But now, the Lord will strip it of its possessions</p>
<p>and hurl its wealth into the sea,</p>
<p>and it shall be devoured by fire.</p>
<p>Ashkelon shall see it and be afraid;</p>
<p></p>Gaza, too, and shall writhe in anguish;</p>
<p>Ekron also, because its hopes are withered.</p>
<p>The king shall perish from Gaza;</p>
<p>Ashkelon shall be uninhabited;</p>
<p>a mongrel people shall settle in Ashdod,</p>
<p>and I will make an end of the pride of Philistia.</p>
<p>I will take away its blood from its mouth</p>
<p>and its abominations from between its teeth;</p>
<p></p>it, too, shall be a remnant for our God;</p>
<p>it shall be like a clan in Judah,</p>
<p>and Ekron shall be like the Jebusites.</p>
<p>Then I will encamp at my house as a guard,</p>
<p>so that no one shall march to and fro;</p>
<p>no oppressor shall again overrun them,</p>
<p>for now I have seen with my own eyes.</p>
<p>Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion!</p>
<p>Shout aloud, O daughter Jerusalem!</p>
<p></p>See, your king comes to you;</p>
<p>triumphant and victorious is he,</p>
<p>humble and riding on a donkey,</p>
<p>on a colt, the foal of a donkey.</p>
<p>He will cut off the chariot from Ephraim</p>
<p>and the war horse from Jerusalem;</p>
<p>and the battle bow shall be cut off,</p>
<p>and he shall command peace to the nations;</p>
<p>his dominion shall be from sea to sea</p>
<p>and from the River to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you,</p>
<p>I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.</p>
<p>Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope;</p>
<p>today I declare that I will restore to you double.</p>
<p>For I have bent Judah as my bow;</p>
<p>I have made Ephraim its arrow.</p>
<p>I will arouse your sons, O Zion,</p>
<p>against your sons, O Greece,</p>
<p>and wield you like a warriorâ€™s sword.</p>
<p>Then the Lord will appear over them,</p>
<p>and his arrow go forth like lightning;</p>
<p>the Lord God will sound the trumpet</p>
<p>and march forth in the whirlwinds of the south.</p>
<p>The Lord of hosts will protect them,</p>
<p>and they shall consume and conquer the slingers;</p>
<p>they shall drink their blood like wine</p>
<p>and be full like a bowl,</p>
<p>drenched like the corners of the altar.</p>
<p>On that day the Lord their God will save them,</p>
<p>for they are the flock of his people,</p>
<p>for like the jewels of a crown</p>
<p>they shall shine on his land.</p>
<p>For what goodness and beauty are his!</p>
<p>Grain shall make the young men flourish,</p>
<p>and new wine the young women.</p>
