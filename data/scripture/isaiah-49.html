<p>Listen to me, O coastlands;</p>
<p>pay attention, you peoples from far away!</p>
<p>The Lord called me before I was born;</p>
<p>while I was in my mother’s womb he named me.</p>
<p>He made my mouth like a sharp sword;</p>
<p>in the shadow of his hand he hid me;</p>
<p>he made me a polished arrow;</p>
<p>in his quiver he hid me away.</p>
<p>And he said to me, “You are my servant,</p>
<p></p>Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”</p>
<p>But I said, “I have labored in vain;</p>
<p>I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;</p>
<p>yet surely my cause is with the Lord</p>
<p>and my reward with my God.”</p>
<p>And now the Lord says,</p>
<p>who formed me in the womb to be his servant,</p>
<p>to bring Jacob back to him,</p>
<p>and that Israel might be gathered to him,</p>
<p>for I am honored in the sight of the Lord,</p>
<p>and my God has become my strength—</p>
<p>he says,</p>
<p>“It is too light a thing that you should be my servant</p>
<p>to raise up the tribes of Jacob</p>
<p>and to restore the survivors of Israel;</p>
<p>I will give you as a light to the nations,</p>
<p>that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord,</p>
<p>the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,</p>
<p>to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations,</p>
<p>the slave of rulers,</p>
<p>“Kings shall see and stand up;</p>
<p></p>princes, and they shall prostrate themselves,</p>
<p>because of the Lord, who is faithful,</p>
<p>the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord:</p>
<p>In a time of favor I have answered you;</p>
<p>on a day of salvation I have helped you;</p>
<p>I have kept you and given you</p>
<p>as a covenant to the people,</p>
<p>to establish the land,</p>
<p>to apportion the desolate heritages,</p>
<p>saying to the prisoners, “Come out,”</p>
<p>to those who are in darkness, “Show yourselves.”</p>
<p>They shall feed along the ways;</p>
<p>on all the bare heights shall be their pasture;</p>
<p>they shall not hunger or thirst,</p>
<p>neither scorching wind nor sun shall strike them down,</p>
<p>for he who has pity on them will lead them</p>
<p>and by springs of water will guide them.</p>
<p>And I will turn all my mountains into a road,</p>
<p>and my highways shall be raised up.</p>
<p></p>Look, some shall come from far away,</p>
<p>some from the north and from the west,</p>
<p>and some from the land of Syene.</p>
<p>Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth;</p>
<p>break forth, O mountains, into singing!</p>
<p>For the Lord has comforted his people</p>
<p>and will have compassion on his suffering ones.</p>
<p>But Zion said, “The Lord has forsaken me;</p>
<p>my Lord has forgotten me.”</p>
<p>Can a woman forget her nursing child</p>
<p>or show no compassion for the child of her womb?</p>
<p>Even these might forget,</p>
<p>yet I will not forget you.</p>
<p></p>See, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands;</p>
<p>your walls are continually before me.</p>
<p>Your builders outdo your destroyers,</p>
<p>and those who laid you waste go away from you.</p>
<p>Lift up your eyes all around and see;</p>
<p>they all gather; they come to you.</p>
<p>As I live, says the Lord,</p>
<p>you shall put all of them on like an ornament,</p>
<p>and like a bride you shall bind them on.</p>
<p>For your wastelands, your desolate places,</p>
<p>and your devastated land—</p>
<p>now you will be too crowded for your inhabitants,</p>
<p>and those who swallowed you up will be far away.</p>
<p>The children born in the time of your bereavement</p>
<p>will yet say in your hearing:</p>
<p>“The place is too crowded for me;</p>
<p>make room for me to settle.”</p>
<p>Then you will say in your heart,</p>
<p>“Who has borne me these?</p>
<p>I was bereaved and barren,</p>
<p>exiled and put away—</p>
<p>so who has reared these?</p>
<p>I was left all alone—</p>
<p></p>where, then, have these come from?”</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord God:</p>
<p>I will soon lift up my hand to the nations</p>
<p>and raise my signal to the peoples,</p>
<p>and they shall bring your sons in their bosom,</p>
<p>and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.</p>
<p>Kings shall be your foster fathers</p>
<p>and their queens your nursing mothers.</p>
<p>With their faces to the ground they shall bow down to you</p>
<p>and lick the dust of your feet.</p>
<p>Then you will know that I am the Lord;</p>
<p>those who wait for me shall not be put to shame.</p>
<p>Can the prey be taken from the mighty</p>
<p>or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?</p>
<p>But thus says the Lord:</p>
<p>Even the captives of the mighty will be taken,</p>
<p>and the prey of the tyrant will be rescued,</p>
<p>for I will contend with those who contend with you,</p>
<p>and I will save your children.</p>
<p>I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh,</p>
<p>and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine.</p>
<p>Then all flesh shall know</p>
<p>that I am the Lord your Savior</p>
<p>and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</p>
