<p>
  Then all the congregation raised a loud cry, and the people wept that night.
  And all the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron; the whole
  congregation said to them, “Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or
  would that we had died in this wilderness! Why is the Lord bringing us into
  this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become
  plunder; would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?” So they said to
  one another, “Let us choose a captain and go back to Egypt.”
</p>

<p>
  Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the
  congregation of the Israelites. And Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of
  Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes
  and said to all the congregation of the Israelites, “The land that we went
  through as spies is an exceedingly good land. If the Lord is pleased with us,
  he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk
  and honey. Only, do not rebel against the Lord, and do not fear the people of
  the land, for they are no more than bread for us; their protection is removed
  from them, and the Lord is with us; do not fear them.” But the whole
  congregation threatened to stone them.
</p>

<p>
  Then the glory of the Lord appeared at the tent of meeting to all the
  Israelites. And the Lord said to Moses, “How long will this people despise me?
  And how long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs that
  I have done among them? I will strike them with pestilence and disinherit
  them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”
</p>

<p>
  But Moses said to the Lord, “Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for in your
  might you brought up this people from among them, and they will tell the
  inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you, O Lord, are in the midst
  of this people, for you, O Lord, are seen face to face, and your cloud stands
  over them and you go in front of them, in a pillar of cloud by day and in a
  pillar of fire by night. Now if you kill this people as one, then the nations
  who have heard about you will say, ‘It is because the Lord was not able to
  bring this people into the land he swore to give them that he has slaughtered
  them in the wilderness.’ And now, therefore, let the power of the Lord be
  great in the way that you promised when you spoke, saying,
</p>

<p>‘The Lord is slow to anger</p>
<p>and abounding in steadfast love,</p>
<p>forgiving iniquity and transgression,</p>
<p>but by no means clearing the guilty,</p>
<p>visiting the iniquity of the parents</p>
<p>upon the children</p>
<p>to the third and the fourth generation.’</p>

<p>
  “Forgive the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your
  steadfast love, just as you have pardoned this people, from Egypt even until
  now.”
</p>

<p>
  Then the Lord said, “I do forgive, just as you have asked; nevertheless, as I
  live and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord, none of
  the people who have seen my glory and the signs that I did in Egypt and in the
  wilderness and yet have tested me these ten times and have not obeyed my voice
  shall see the land that I swore to give to their ancestors; none of those who
  despised me shall see it. But my servant Caleb, because he has a different
  spirit and has followed me wholeheartedly, I will bring into the land into
  which he went, and his descendants shall possess it. Now, since the Amalekites
  and the Canaanites live in the valleys, turn tomorrow and set out for the
  wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”
