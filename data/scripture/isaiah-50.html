<p>Thus says the Lord:</p>
<p>Where is your motherâ€™s bill of divorce</p>
<p>with which I dismissed her?</p>
<p>Or which of my creditors is it</p>
<p>to whom I have sold you?</p>
<p></p>No, because of your sins you were sold,</p>
<p>and for your transgressions your mother was dismissed.</p>
<p>Why was no one there when I came?</p>
<p>Why did no one answer when I called?</p>
<p>Is my arm powerless to redeem?</p>
<p>Or have I no strength to deliver?</p>
<p>By my rebuke I dry up the sea;</p>
<p>I make the rivers a desert,</p>
<p>so that their fish stink for lack of water</p>
<p>and die of thirst.</p>
<p>I clothe the heavens with blackness</p>
<p>and make sackcloth their covering.</p>
<p>The Lord God has given me</p>
<p>a trained tongue,</p>
<p>that I may know how to sustain</p>
<p>the weary with a word.</p>
<p>Morning by morning he wakens,</p>
<p>wakens my ear</p>
<p>to listen as those who are taught.</p>
<p>The Lord God has opened my ear,</p>
<p>and I was not rebellious;</p>
<p>I did not turn backward.</p>
<p>I gave my back to those who struck me</p>
<p>and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;</p>
<p>I did not hide my face</p>
<p>from insult and spitting.</p>
<p>The Lord God helps me;</p>
<p>therefore I have not been disgraced;</p>
<p>therefore I have set my face like flint,</p>
<p>and I know that I shall not be put to shame;</p>
<p>he who vindicates me is near.</p>
<p>Who will contend with me?</p>
<p>Let us stand in court together.</p>
<p>Who are my adversaries?</p>
<p>Let them confront me.</p>
<p>It is the Lord God who helps me;</p>
<p>who will declare me guilty?</p>
<p>All of them will wear out like a garment;</p>
<p>the moth will eat them up.</p>
<p>Who among you fears the Lord</p>
<p>and obeys the voice of his servant,</p>
<p>who walks in darkness</p>
<p>and has no light,</p>
<p>yet trusts in the name of the Lord</p>
<p>and relies upon his God?</p>
<p>But all of you are kindlers of fire,</p>
<p>lighters of firebrands.</p>
<p>Walk in the flame of your fire</p>
<p>and among the brands that you have kindled!</p>
<p>This is what you shall have from my hand:</p>
<p>you shall lie down in torment.</p>
