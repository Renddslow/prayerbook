<p>
  Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered
  pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified: Mercifully grant
  that we, walking in the way of the Cross, may find it none other than the way
  of life and peace; through 23 Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with
  you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <strong>Amen.</strong>
