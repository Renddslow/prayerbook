  O Lord our God, whose blessed Son gave his back to be whipped and did not hide
  his face from shame and spitting: Give us grace to accept joyfully the
  sufferings of the present time, confident of the glory that shall be revealed;
  through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
  Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <strong>Amen.</strong>
