<p>
  Almighty Father, whose most dear Son, on the night before he suffered,
  instituted the Sacrament of his Body and Blood: Mercifully grant that we may
  receive it in thankful remembrance of Jesus Christ our Savior, who in these
  holy mysteries gives us a pledge of eternal life; and who lives and reigns
  with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.
  <strong>Amen.</strong>
