<p>
  Heavenly Father, you have made us for yourself, and our hearts are restless
  until they rest in you: Look with compassion upon the heartfelt desires of
  your servants, and purify our disordered affections, that we may behold your
  eternal glory in the face of Christ Jesus; who lives and reigns with you and
  the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <strong>Amen.</strong>
