<p>
  Almighty God, you alone can bring into order the unruly wills and affections
  of sinners: Grant your people grace to love what you command and desire what
  you promise; that, among the swift and varied changes of this world, our
  hearts may surely there be fixed where true joys are to be found; through
  Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one
  God, now and for ever. <strong>Amen.</strong>
