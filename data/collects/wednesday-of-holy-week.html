<p>
  Assist us mercifully with your grace, Lord God of our salvation, that we may
  enter with joy upon the meditation of those mighty acts by which you have
  promised us life and immortality; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and
  reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.
  <strong>Amen.</strong>
