<p>
  Almighty God, who through your only-begotten Son Jesus Christ overcame death
  and opened to us the gate of everlasting life: Grant that we, who celebrate
  with joy the day of the Lord's resurrection, may, by your life-giving Spirit,
  be delivered from sin and raised from death; through Jesus Christ our Lord,
  who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.
  <strong>Amen.</strong>
